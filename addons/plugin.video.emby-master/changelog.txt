version 1.1.25
This contains a fix for music.
More info: 
- We are now processing your music in batch of 200 items. You might see the scan get stuck at one point, it's very normal since the add-on is pulling all the data from your server for the next section to process. For music, we process the sections in the following order after boxsets: Artists, Albums, Songs.
For example, the scan gets stuck at 98% for Albums, it is currently pulling all your songs from your server. If you have a large amount of items for the songs section, it will take longer and might give the impression the scan is stuck, when it's not. :) Hopefully we will be able to improve the visual logging the reflect this in the future.
Please, let us know if you still see mentions of read timeout in your logs when scanning your music library in or if the scan still doesn't complete

version 1.1.24
- Sorry for the many updates in a row! Fix for video nodes not showing up.

version 1.1.22

version 1.1.21
- Fixed video node and source creation when using the new fast startup sync

version 1.1.20
- Added new fast startup sync feature. check out http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/23971-fast-startup-sync-server-plugin/

version 1.1.19
- This version fixes the missing duration from home widgets

version 1.1.18
- We should be back on track with this build. The initial sync should complete once again. To make sure everything goes smoothly, you will need to reset and resync your library after updating to 1.1.18. Music also received a much needed update, thank you @marcelveldt. 

version 1.1.17
- This version has support for Kodi 16 (aka Jarvis) - full rebuild needed. Allows video themes to be excluded when syncing theme media, contains a fix for non persistent settings and for local media flags

version 1.1.16
- Fix for the issue causing the initial sync to fail with 1.1.15.

version 1.1.15
Features:
- Added the option to delete movies after playback
- Resume jumpback (in seconds)
Fixes:
- Precise resume points
- Theme media - direct stream syncing
- Cast order should be the same as Emby's for Kodi Helix and Isengard
- Genres - Clean up genres if modified, as well as correctly display Genres for TV shows.
- Masterlock - We now create sources during the first initial sync. This means your library should now display when using Masterlock.
- Error during login - due to Emby "disable access user preferences" setting.
- Plugin paths now support mediaflags (bluray, 3D, etc) and should properly reflect this when navigating your Kodi library (MQ cases, etc.).
- Kodi audio and subtitles track should now be remembered after being changed.
- Make report progress to Emby more accurate
- Remote command should now be accepted during the first minute of playback.
Changes:
- The library syncing process was moved to it's on thread. In general, the add-on should perform faster and be more responsive. Especially at startup.
- Improved information logging (1) so you are able to see the exact content being processed.

version 1.1.14
- This version contains a fix for the cast order presented on the video info screens. It is restricted to Kodi 15 and onwards.
- A complete resync of the database will be needed to pick up the changes

version 1.1.13
Fix:
- If you were unable to launch scripts from the Emby add-on launch menu, this is now resolved.
Features:
- Cover art - Fix for cut off cover art
- Local/remote access from same Kodi profile ** This is not Emby connect **
Cover art:
- Add-on settings > Extras > Force CoverArt ratio
If your poster CoverArt is cut off, you can enable this option to force the artwork to fit the standard Kodi image aspect ratio (image will be slightly distorted). Since images are cached in Kodi, you will need to reset/resync your library to see your artwork change. ** You should still request to fix the aspect ratio issue by posting in the appropriate thread to contact the skin creator. Using the Confluence skin, for example, displays Cover art correctly, without distorting the image. **
Local/remote access:
- Add-on settings > Emby > Use alternate address / Secondary Server Address
This feature is useful in the event you are on the move. You simply enable the option and enter your external server address, restart Kodi and it should now load your profile using your external address instead. This way you can enable Play from HTTP and stream/transcode while away from home! To recap, the secondary server address is only to reach the same server as the primary server address



version 1.1.0
- stable release
- Note that the secondary IP address support in this release is still a BETA feature.
-  Note that the beta is likely to go more unstable for a bit - so if you are using Beta - you might disable auto update, or switch to stable.


version 1.0.15
- If having the auto caching images setting enabled was causing an issue while syncing, this should now be resolved. Other improvements have been made regarding widgets refresh rate for new content, theme media and direct paths.

version 1.0.14
- The last version assured a show/movie would have either a theme video or theme music as this was what the nfo format supported (which tvtunes reads and we create). However this was restrictive so a change has been made to include all theme media and with the help of the upcoming tvtunes version (5.0.2 onwards) it has options to prefer theme videos etc.

version 1.0.13
- The only difference to the previous version is a possible fix for theme music import with strange characters in the filename

version 1.0.12
- This version adds theme videos to the theme media sync, for people using theme videos you will need to run the option to "sync emby theme media to kodi" again

version 1.0.10
Important: 
- We reverted the database detection method from previous version (1.0.09) back to a static method. This means we currently support Helix 14.2 (MyVideos90.db) and Isengard Beta 2 (MyVideos93.db).
 Fix: 
- Illegal characters in file name for Theme music (should now be finally fixed!)
 Optimization:
- Season posters should now reflect instantly when changed in Emby
- Fanart backdrops should now reflect correctly when changed in Emby - give several seconds to see the new backdrop appear.
- Added Series poster as All Season poster. - you will need to reset - resync library for them to show for already established Series.
- Watched status should now be instant. Please test and report any issues.

version 1.0.09
- Important database detection change: We are trying something new. The famous error "can't find table id Path" or similar, when starting the sync happens in the event the add-on is unable to locate your Kodi database file. We are trying a more dynamic way of getting this information in order to eradicate this error. So keep your eyes peeled in the event the database is not found and report ASAP with logs as we are unsure of this change. It is really appreciated!
TV Tunes, Theme music:
- Fix for invalid characters in filename **Still needs work**
- Fix for special characters.
- Automatically set the custom path in your TV Tunes settings, so you don't have to (this allows TV Tunes to find your Emby themes). This means your themes will start working instantly. Make sure TV Tunes is enabled for the skin you are using!
- The feature should now be compatible with OpenElec.
- Video backdrops are coming soon!
Youtube trailers:
- Youtube Trailers should now work and be launched using the youtube add-on. However, it will require a reset - resync of your database.

version 1.0.08
- Attempt at supporting Isengard Beta 2
- Caused error with special chars
- Disable audio-subs pref
- increase logging verbosity for WebSocket message errors
- with direct paths make sure a path was returned

version 1.0.07
- added stream language and subtitle language to stream details
- prevent errors on empty results
- Re-add connection message 
- Support multiple theme songs

version 1.0.06
- bug fix

version 1.0.05
Fix:
- Error that was preventing the initial sync from running the first time around on fresh installs.
Highlight:
- As you know, using plugin paths, the Kodi's custom video settings were not sticking (audio and subtitles). We've implement an internal logic that will pick the correct setting automatically according to your Emby user preferences. It works with every type of playback: Direct Play, Direct Stream, Transcoding and Direct Paths. You will also find an additional option under the Playback tab in settings to "Always enable subtitles". With this change, there's no more need for Kodi's custom video settings

version 1.0.04
- Texture Cache now included in the addon. You can set an option to scan the images to the texture cache  on setup or when new data is added. The Cinema Mode and User preferences mentioned in 1.0.02 are back.
- Please note that Cinema mode is not currently compatible with Kodi's option: Play next video automatically.

version 1.0.02
- This version now supports Cinema Mode/Intros and has the start of support for some user preferences. Currently the only setting is cinema mode, but we will extend this to support the audio language and maybe other settings in the future.

version 1.0.1
- In this version the netflix style next up functionality has been removed from the addon and placed into a separate addon. If you would still like to use this functionality install the nextup service from the beta repo
- also stable release

version 1.0.0
- Stable release

version 0.1.94
- Fix for TV episode info not showing when using direct paths on a password protected network


version 0.1.93
- Bug fix for NON-direct path mode.  Sorry - made a copy/paste error :(  This will have caused missing music videos/TV shows, and bad syncing of states for music videos/TV Shows

version 0.1.92
- New option to point directly to files instead of going through the addon for playback.  This will speed up playback on low end devices, and allow addons like TV Tunes to work - but at the cost of losing remote playback, transcoding support and parental control.  Once turned on, you must reset your DB to use
- Fix for slow syncing after wakeup.  However if using OpenElec I suggest a restart on wake as described here: http://openelec.tv/f...start=15#101953 (using kodi instead of xbmc though)
- Option to ignore specials in NextUp
- Added votes and taglines for movies
- Fix for 'Start from beginning'
- Getting REALLY close to our 1.0 releas

version 0.1.9/91
- Temporary removal of the service monitor, until it can be implemented without interfering with other functions. This means if you had trouble playing content because of it, it should be working again.
- Fix the delay in marking watched after content has just been watched in Kodi. This should now be reflected instantly.

version 0.1.89
- Alright guys, we are nearing a stable version. It is important you let us know if something is not working correctly for you! The best thing you can do to help us is to start from scratch and let us know if you experience any issues during the process, from start to finish! If everything goes well for everyone, we will release our first Stable version! 
- If you were unable to get Direct playback when content had special character in the name, this should now be fixed (for real this time).
- We have been reviewing the playcount/watch status situation and tweak certain Kodi behaviors to allow for a perfect sync of your playstates between Emby and Kodi. This is a follow up to the previous update. The correct Emby playcount should display now.
- As usual, if something doesn't work as intended, please start a new thread and provide a log. Hopefully, you will not. *fingers crossed!*

version 0.1.86
- Clean up empty TV Shows when last episode deleted by web socket
- Add option to suppress successful connection message
- Fix 'offer delete' bug accidental introduced in previous release

version 0.1.83/85
- The playcount situation should be resolved. If you saw an item be marked as watched before the 90% this should be fixed. As well as rewatching an item, it should now stop marking it as unwatched.
- We now support Webclient remote control! It's so much fun

version 0.1.82
- The addon now respects Parental control for access schedules
- Adding a new series (that was never imported to Kodi during initial sync) and changing boxsets should be picked up instantly on event

version 0.1.81
- Officially fixes playback for files containing special characters.

version 0.1.8
We now support:
- split videos - if you do have them, please let us know if it works correctly.
- You can now send messages from the web client to Kodi
- Final touches for music support
- Added Genres and sets to video nodes and sublevels
Fixes:
- TV Shows: Recently added, in progress nodes are now filtered by the parent folder to show the appropriate content
- Fix for path containing special characters failing to playback
- Speed improvement when using Kodi Isengard
- EDIT: Emby for Kodi should behave if you also have tvtunes and videoextras addon enabled.

version 0.1.6
- fixes an error with playback

version 0.1.5
- Adds dialog to delete episodes for realz when hitting the delete key
- Adds option to offer delete when playback is >80%
- Fixes widget playback

version 0.1.4
New feature:
- Thanks to @marcelveldt we are now able to support your Emby music library. It is an optional feature. Please try it out and report back as it is experimental at this stage. You can find the option in your addon settings under Sync Options. After you have enabled the option, you will need to restart Kodi.
Noteworthy:
- New content is now added during playback instead of at the end of it. We thought "almost instant" was not good enough, we opted for instant instead!  :)
- The playback went through a major rework. Local paths are now supported (this means you are no longer forced to use UNC path to view content available on the same device). We made the playback smart. Now, instead of failing on one method (let's say Direct play), it will try to play via Direct Stream and then Transcoding before giving you an error. It will still let you know if it failed to launch via direct play, so you are not in the dark. 
Fix:
- video nodes not being created when you were switching Kodi profiles
- "Year" format for seasons are now supported
- Missing seasons (hopefully?...let us know!)
- Online server check offline even if server was online
- We forgot to mention that boxsets should be fixed, since the previous version. This should cover add/remove content from boxsets and displaying the correct boxset cover.
- Other minor fixes....

version 0.1.2/3
- Playcount fix for unwatched count
- Video Nodes now working for multi-profiles
- Convenient listing for everything Emby when you launch the Emby for Kodi add-on (like it is with the Mediabrowser add-on).
- Add and Remove users from the viewing session (read below for everything you know about this feature!)

version 0.1.0
- Uses a new approach to interact with Kodi DB (Direct Access) You will need to do a Kodi DB reset for this new update
- In the Emby Addon settings under Advanced select "Reset Local Kodi DB"
- 10x+ speed improvement
- Sync reliability improvements
- Works fine on RaspPi 1 now
- Seamless switching from SMB to HTTP
- Box set art fixed
- Sync after resume fixed
- Disable coverart option added
- Transcoding options added
- Video nodes to mimic Emby nodes added
- Date created fix
- Native support for 'extra fanart'
- Dashboard viewing bug fixes
- 3D stream support
- New eTag server feature for stale data implemented
- 'Watched' fixes
 
In short - if you tried this addon and thought it was slow/inaccurate, please give it another go.
 
Reminder:  You need to reset your DB for this release - but it is MUCH faster on initial sync, and follow up syncs are almost instant
 
version 0.0.33
- Playcount fix
- Playback report/resume fix.


version 0.0.31/32
- Emby for Kodi can now support HTTPS fully. This works the same as it would in a browser. You can enable/disable Host certificate verification and if you use a custom ssl certificate for your Emby server, you also have the option to add a client-side ssl certificate(.pem). By default, only enabling the HTTPS option should work for most HTTPS connection (self-signed certificates).
- Minor fixes that affects the initial sync and sending a remote stream to Kodi.


version 0.0.30
- New download system implemented - hopefully this will make the syncing process less lengthy.
- Special character fix for Emby username.


version 0.0.29
 - Fixed a lockup issue with sync when syncing episodes with no season

version 0.0.28
- Fix updates during playback
- Fix issues with deletes
- Images fixes

- Fix episode specials showing up in all seasons

version 0.0.25
- Fixed the option to reset your database, it should now work on every platform. You will be offered with the option to delete your database, followed by the option to erase your saved user information. Yay!
- HTTPS is now fully implemented. (custom certificate not yet accepted - server self signed should work)
- Custom settings for transcoding are now added in the add-on settings.
- Fixed Kodi "hanging" when shutting down.


version 0.0.24
- This version has a major change: at startup, a full sync is performed, however after that ALL syncing is done using websocket messages from the server.  This results in much faster updating, and way less CPU use
- ALSO - there is a big change to the "plot" support - so the first time you run it is going to take a while to get the plots all fixed up.

version 0.0.23
- changed the AutoPlay function a little bit. What it now does is popup in the last 20 seconds of play and gives the option to cancel viewing the next episode. This repeats at the end of each episode rather than how it was before where it added the full list of remaining episodes to play
- This version also adds back the 'play from HTTP' option.  In a clean build it will ask you if you want to play from HTTP.  Otherwise change it in settings and your database will slowly change over to point to the HTTP path

version 0.0.22
- added support for Kodi Isengard
- fixed ratings for all media types
- fixed episode thumbnails
- some code cleanup and small typos fixed
- Multiple profiles/users now working. You can setup each Kodi profile with a different Emby user.

version 0.0.21
- Now can use the "Easy Pin" option on local networks for signing in thanks to @Angelblue05
- For those who like to binge watch series I added an option to "AutoPlay" the remaining episodes in a Season. This works with the "Ongoing Episodes/Next UP" widgets found on many home screens and attempts to sort of emulate the way it is done with Netflix. If you have enabled the option in the settings after playback has ended a dialog will popup asking if you want to carry on watching the remaining episodes...this dialog will auto time out after 10 seconds and if nothing is done proceeds to add the remaining episodes to a playlist which is then played

version 0.0.16
- More speedups!
- Fixed TV tags
- If you don't specify the type of a collection, we now assume it is movies (but you should specify..)

version 0.0.15
- New version has much, much, much faster initial import - plus support for TV collections

version 0.0.14
- some HUGE speed improvements with the initial sync time

version 0.0.13
- reduces the initial sync time for new installs but provides no additional changes for current users

version 0.0.12
- alter reset so that addon data dir is always removed when video db
- box set sync no longer an option
- solve encoding issue with playurl

version 0.0.10
- For those where the reset fails you now only need to delete the video database manually ""userdata/Database/MyVideo90.db"" (note version may differ if not running a Helix version of Kodi)

version 0.0.9
- This version changes a lot under the hood and needs a clean start to proceed. We have provided a reset option in the addon under advanced settings for this

version 0.0.1
- initital alpha version
